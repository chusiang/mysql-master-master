NAME
  mmm_get_dump - MySQL Master-Master get dump utility

SYNOPSIS
  mmm_get_dump [--config <config file>] --host <host> [--copy-method <method>] [--dest-dir <dir>]

DESCRIPTION
  MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
  to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master-Master replication 
  cluster configurations.

  mmm_get_dump is a utility to get consistent dumps of a mysql database
  from a remote host. It calls create_snapshot(1) on the remote host to 
  create a LVM snapshot which is then used as source for the dump. It
  deletes the LVM snapshot using remove_snapshot(1) after the dump has
  finished.

OPTIONS

  --config <config file>
                - Read configuration from this file. Default is $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf.

  --host <host>
                - Remote host from which the dump should be taken. Must be one
                  of the hosts specified in mmm_lvm.conf(5).

  --copy-method <method>
                - With the default configuration mmm_lvm.conf(5) shipped with
                  MMM this script supports the following methods to copy the
                  dump from the remote host:

                  * scp    - uses scp(1) with blowfish encryption. This is the
                             default copy method.
                  * rdiff  - needs rdiff-backup(1) installed on both local and
                             remote host. Supports incremental backups.
                  * ssh-gz - uses ssh(1) with blowfish encryption and tar(1) to
                             copy the data from the remote host and gzip(1) to
                             compress it on the local host.

  --dest-dir <dir>
                - Destination directory for the dump. Will be created if it does
                  not exist. Defaults to the dest_dir specified in mmm_lvm.conf(5).

CONFIGURATION
  This script uses $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf file for its configuration.
