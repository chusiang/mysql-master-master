DESCRIPTION
  MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
  to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master-Master replication 
  cluster configurations.

  mmm_control is an interface script to mmmd_mon internals. It could perform 
  following operaitons:
    * Check monitoring daemon status (ping).
    * Show current cluster state (with IPs/Roles/Hosts/States).
    * Change hosts states (online/admin_offline).
    * Move exclusive roles between hosts.

  mmm_control itself does not have dedicated config file. It reads mmmd_mon(1) 
  config files to get monitoring daemon control port.

OPTIONS AND COMMANDS
  @cluster_name  This option should be always specified first. If it is used, 
    then mmm_control would try to read mmmd_mon(1) configuration from 
    $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_mon_cluster_name.conf file.

  ping  Connects to local monitoring daemon and checks its status.

  show  Displays detailed information about current mmm-cluster state 
    including hosts states, roles and IPs assignments and monitoring daemon 
    status.

  set_online hostname  Changes host status for specified host from 
    admin_offline or awaiting_recovery to online and performs roles 
    rebalancing.

  set_offline hostname  Changes host status for specified host from any 
    non-offline state to to admin_offline and performs roles rebalancing.
  
  move_role rolename hostname  Could be used for 'exclusive' roles only. 
    Moves 'exclusive' role from one ONLINE host to another and performs roles
    rebalancing.

CONFIGURATION
  This script uses $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_mon.conf file for its configuration. 
  If cluster name option provided, then $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_mon_cluster_name.conf 
  file used.

SEE ALSO
  More information could be found in mmm_mon.conf(5), mmmd_mon(1).
