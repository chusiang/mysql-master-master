NAME
  mmm_clone - MySQL Master-Master clone utility

SYNOPSIS
  mmm_clone [--config <config file>] --host <host> --clone-mode <mode> [--copy-method <method>]

DESCRIPTION
  MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
  to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master-Master replication 
  cluster configurations.

  mmm_clone is a utility to get a clone of a remote mysql database
  up and running locally. It utilizes mmm_get_dump(1).

OPTIONS

  --config <config file>
                - Read configuration from this file. Default is $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf.

  --host <host>
                - Remote host from which should be cloned. Must be one of the
                  hosts specified in mmm_lvm.conf(5).

  --clone-mode <mode>
                - Clone mode

                  * slave-slave
                           - Create a local slave from a remote slave. Will set
                             up replication using the master of the source host
                             as new master.
                  * master-slave
                           - Create a local slave from a remote master. Will
                             set up replication using the source host as new
                             master.
                  * master-master
                           - Create a local master from a remote master. Will
                             set up local replication using the source host as
                             new master and remote replication using the local
                             host as new master.

  --copy-method <method>
                - With the default configuration mmm_lvm.conf(5) shipped with
                  MMM this script supports the following methods to copy the
                  dump from the remote host. Please note, that only copy
                  methods that create a 1:1 copy should be used!

                  * scp    - uses scp(1) with blowfish encryption. This is the
                             default copy method.
                  * rdiff  - needs rdiff-backup(1) installed on both local and
                             remote host. Supports incremental backups.
                             Note: Will work with mmm_clone, but doesn't make
                             much sense.
                  * ssh-gz - uses ssh(1) with blowfish encryption and tar(1) to
                             copy the data from the remote host and gzip(1) to
                             compress it on the local host.
                             Note: Won't work with mmm_clone.
