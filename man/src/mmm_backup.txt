NAME
  mmm_backup - MySQL Master-Master backup utility

SYNOPSIS
  mmm_backup [--config <config file>] --host <host> --dest-dir <dir> [--copy-method <method>]

DESCRIPTION
  MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
  to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master-Master replication 
  cluster configurations.

  mmm_backup is a utility to create consistent backups of a mysql database
  with the help of mmm_get_dump(1). Incremental backups may be created using
  the copy method "rdiff".

OPTIONS

  --config <config file>
                - Read configuration from this file. Default is $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf.

  --host <host>
                - Remote host from which the backup should be taken. Must be one
                  of the hosts specified in mmm_lvm.conf(5).

  --dest-dir <dir>
                - Destination directory for the backup. Will be created if it
                  does not exist. Must be empty if the copy method does not allow
                  incremental backups.

  --copy-method <method>
                - With the default configuration mmm_lvm.conf(5) shipped with
                  MMM this script supports the following methods to copy the
                  data from the remote host:

                  * scp    - uses scp(1) with blowfish encryption. This is the
                             default copy method.
                  * rdiff  - needs rdiff-backup(1) installed on both local and
                             remote host. Supports incremental backups.
                  * ssh-gz - uses ssh(1) with blowfish encryption and tar(1) to
                             copy the data from the remote host and gzip(1) to
                             compress it on the local host.
CONFIGURATION
  This script uses $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf file for its configuration.
