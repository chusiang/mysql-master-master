= F.A.Q =

=== How many IP addresses do I need? ===

You will need one for each MySQL server and one for each role. 
 * 2(N)+1 where N is the number of servers.
 *For a simple two server master master cluster you will need 5.
   * server 1
   * server 2
   * writer role
   * reader role 1
   * reader role 2
 * For a larger four machine cluster you would need 9.
   * server 1
   * server 2
   * server 3
   * server 4
   * writer role
   * reader role 1
   * reader role 2
   * reader role 3
   * reader role 4


=== How is MMM different from an LVS solution for managing MySQL clusters ===

MMM does not any balancing between mysql servers it just keeps system
alive by monitoring all servers in cluster and moving roles when some
server dies. So I think we should say not "LVS vs MMM", but "LVS +
MMM".


=== How is MMM checking the MySQL servers ===

MMM perform following checks for every server:
  # IP connectivity (fping)
  # MySQL connectivity (mysql connect and SELECT NOW())
  # MySQL IO and SQL threads status (SHOW SLAVE STATUS)
  # MySQL replication backlog - seconds behind master (SHOW SLAVE STATUS)

In addition to these checks MMM manages read-only mode on the server
to be sure that slaves could not process reads and only active master
could.
