#summary Our development plans and roadmap
#labels Phase-Implementation

= TODO =

Definitely will be added:
  * Log::Log4Perl for logging (external config for logging, flexible logging modules for file, syslog and even email logging)
  * OO-based design with careful distribution of functionality between classes (easy to test).
  * Test-driven development (what test framework to use?)
  * Devel::DumpSizes + USR1 signal handler in daemons for memory debugging (or something else for memory leaks searching).
  

Maybe will be added:
  * Agent-monitor protocol change: Maybe some xml one would be better?
  * Configuration broadcasts and status restore from agents in case of clean (w/o status file) start.
