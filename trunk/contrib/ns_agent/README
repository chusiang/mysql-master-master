README for mmm_ns_agent contribution
------------------------------------

MMM is a great tool for maintaining a Mysql Master Master Replication cluster.
(http://blog.kovyrin.net/mysql-master-master-replication-manager/)

MMM depends on the ability of the machines in the network to have floating IP addresses
and to send ARP notifications to the network peers.

Unfortunately, computing clouds (such as Amazon EC2) do not enable this feature, and you
have no control on the IP addresses of your machines.

Therefore, this contribution was made in order to allow the use of MMM in an environemnt
where modifications on the network level are not available, but you do have control of
a nameserver in the network.

To use this:

	1. On nameserver machine:
	   
	   1.1 Edit mmm_ns_agent.conf to your liking (port and name of zone file).
	   
	   1.2 Configure the nameserver to answer queries for mydomain.com, have very low TTL,
    	   and make sure the zone file name matches the one in mmm_ns_agent.conf. 
	   
	   1.3 Run ns_agent.php (for example, `php ns_agent.php`).
	       You should probably write a init.d/ script to run it for you, 
	       maybe in a screen session.
	
	2. On the database nodes:
	   
	   2.1 Add the following section to mmm_agent.conf on all database nodes:

		   nameserver <<nameserver_name>>
		        ip <<nameserver ip address>>
		        port <<ns_agent port>>

	   2.2 Replace /usr/local/mmm/lib/ifconfig.pm with the one provided with this
	       contribution.

	3. On the monitor node:
	   
	   3.1 In the mmm monitor daemon config (mmm_mon.conf), replace any occurence of
	       the floating IP address with the FQDN of the relevant host. For example:

	       Replace:
		       role writer
		            mode exclusive
		            servers ec2_db1
		            ip 192.168.100.101
	        With:
		       role writer
		            mode exclusive
		            servers ec2_db1
	   	            ip writer.mydomain.com

	4. On your application machine:
	   
	   4.1 Set database host references from IP addresses to hostnames.
	       For example (php):
	       define('DB_HOST_WRITER','writer.mydomain.com');
	       define('DB_HOST_READERS',array('reader1.mydomain.com','reader2.mydomain.com');
	
	5. On all machines (application, monitor, db nodes):
	  
	   5.1 Set resolver to your nameserver.

May we never have failing production clusters!
