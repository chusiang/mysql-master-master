.SH DESCRIPTION
MMM (MySQL Master\-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master\-Master replication 
cluster configurations.
.PP
\fBmmm_get_dump\fP is a utility to get consistent dumps of a mysql database
from a remote host. It calls \fBcreate_snapshot\fP(1) on the remote host to 
create a LVM snapshot which is then used as source for the dump. It
deletes the LVM snapshot using \fBremove_snapshot\fP(1) after the dump has
finished.

default copy method.
.IP \(bu 3

remote host. Supports incremental backups.
.IP \(bu 3
ssh\-gz
\- uses \fBssh\fP(1) with blowfish encryption and \fBtar\fP(1) to
copy the data from the remote host and \fBgzip\fP(1) to
compress it on the local host.
\fB\-\-dest\-dir\fP <dir>
\- Destination directory for the dump. Will be created if it does
not exist. Defaults to the dest_dir specified in \fBmmm_lvm.conf\fP(5).
