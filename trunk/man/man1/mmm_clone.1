to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master\-Master replication 
cluster configurations.
.PP
\fBmmm_clone\fP is a utility to get a clone of a remote mysql database
up and running locally. It utilizes \fBmmm_get_dump\fP(1).

\- Read configuration from this file. Default is $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf.

\- Remote host from which should be cloned. Must be one of the
hosts specified in \fBmmm_lvm.conf\fP(5).
.PP
\fB\-\-clone\-mode\fP <mode>
\- Clone mode
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
slave\-slave
\- Create a local slave from a remote slave. Will set
up replication using the master of the source host
as new master.

set up replication using the source host as new
master.

\fB\-\-copy\-method\fP <method>
\- With the default configuration \fBmmm_lvm.conf\fP(5) shipped with
MMM this script supports the following methods to copy the
dump from the remote host. Please note, that only copy
methods that create a 1:1 copy should be used!
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
scp
\- uses \fBscp\fP(1) with blowfish encryption. This is the
default copy method.
.IP \(bu 3
rdiff
\- needs \fBrdiff\-backup\fP(1) installed on both local and
remote host. Supports incremental backups.
Note: Will work with \fBmmm_clone\fP, but doesn't make
much sense.
.IP \(bu 3
ssh\-gz
\- uses \fBssh\fP(1) with blowfish encryption and \fBtar\fP(1) to
copy the data from the remote host and \fBgzip\fP(1) to
compress it on the local host.
Note: Won't work with \fBmmm_clone\fP.
.SH CONFIGURATION
This script uses $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf file for its configuration.
