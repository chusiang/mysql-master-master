NAME
  mmmd_mon - MySQL Master-Master Manager Daemon

SYNOPSIS
  mmmd_mon
  mmmd_mon @cluster_name

DESCRIPTION
  MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts
  to perform monitoring and management of MySQL Master-Master replication 
  cluster configurations.

  mmmd_mon is a central part of entire MMM-cluster. It runs on dedicated 
  monitoring server or on one of client servers which use MySQL cluster.

  This script performs monitoring of all servers described in its config 
  file, maintains set of roles/IPs and tries to keep entire cluster alive 
  when some of its nodes are dying.

  At this moment monitoring script could perform following checks on 
  remote servers:
    * ping
    * mysql connect
    * mysql replication threads state
    * mysql replication lag

  Details about monitoring configuration and checkers configuration could be
  found in another sections of this manual dedicated to config files 
  description: mmm_agent.conf(5), mmm_mon.conf (5) and other.

OPTIONS
  @cluster_name - This is the only option at this time. If it is used, 
                  then mmmd_mon would try to read configuration from 
                  $BASE_DIR/etc/mmm_mon_cluster_name.conf file.

CONFIGURATION
  This script uses $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_mon.conf file for its configuration. 
  If cluster name option provided, then $BASE_DIR/etc/mmm_mon_cluster_name.conf 
  file is used.

SEE ALSO
  More information could be found in mmmd_agent(1), mmm_mon.conf(5).
