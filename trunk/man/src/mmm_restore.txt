  mmm_restore is a utility to restore a backup created with mmm_backup(1) locally.

OPTIONS

  --config <config file>
                - Read configuration from this file. Default is $BASEDIR/etc/mmm_lvm.conf.

  --backup-dir <dir>
                - Directory where backup resides.

  --mode <mode>
                - Restore mode:

                  * data-only
                           - Only restore data - do not set up replication.
                  * single-single
                           - Same as data-only
                  * slave-single 
                           - Same as data-only
                  * master-single
                           - Same as data-only
                  * master-slave
                           - Restore slave from master backup. Will set up
                             replication using the source host as new master.
                  * slave-slave
                           - Restore slave from slave backup. Will set up
                             replication using the master of the source host
                             as new master.

  --data-dir <dir>
                - datadir of local mysql installation. Will be created if it 
                  does not exist.

  --version <version | list>
                - When run with 'list' parameter, displays available versions
                  of incremental backups. If version is specified, tries to
                  restore backup for specified version of datadir.

  --dry-run		- Check everything and exit without any changes.
