README for mmm_ns_agent contribution
------------------------------------

MMM is a great tool for maintaining a Mysql Master Master Replication cluster.
(http://blog.kovyrin.net/mysql-master-master-replication-manager/)

MMM depends on the ability of the machines in the network to have floating IP addresses
and to send ARP notifications to the network peers.

Unfortunately, computing clouds (such as Amazon EC2) do not enable this feature, and you
have no control on the IP addresses of your machines.

Therefore, this contribution was made in order to allow the use of MMM in an environemnt
where modifications on the network level are not available, but you do have control of
a nameserver in the network.

To use this:

	1. Run ns_agent.php (accompanied by mmm_ns_agent.conf) on the nameserver
	   machine.
	
	2. Add the following section to mmm_agent.conf on all database nodes:

		nameserver <<nameserver_name>>
		        ip <<nameserver ip address>>
		        port <<ns_agent port>>

	3. Replace /usr/local/mmm/lib/ifconfig.pm with the one provided with this
	   contribution.

	4. On the mmm monitor daemon config (mmm_mon.conf), replace any occurence of
	   the floating IP address with the FQDN of the relevant host. For example:

	   Replace:
		role writer
		    mode exclusive
		    servers ec2_db1
		    ip 192.168.100.101
	   With:
		role writer
		    mode exclusive
		    servers ec2_db1
	   	    ip writer.mydomain.com

	5. Configure the nameserver to answer queries for mydomain.com, have very low TTL,
    	   and make sure the zone file name matches the one in mmm_ns_agent.conf.

	6. Set all the machines resolver to your nameserver.

May we never have failing production clusters!
