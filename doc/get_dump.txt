This tool allows user to get consistent backup of all mysql datadir files from remote server.

will be locked by "flush tables with read lock" and will be unlocked just after snapshot creation 
by "unlock tables".

this moment scp and rsync methods are implemented and tested).

as params.

* this SERVER_NAME - name of current server

* bin_lvcreate /sbin/lvcreate - path to lvcreate binary 
* bin_lvremove /sbin/lvremove - path to lvremove binary

* dest_dir /data_local - destination directory on local server where all copied files will be placed.

* default_copy_method scp - default copying method (will be used if user would not provide other method in command line)

* copy_method MATHOD_NAME - set of sections used to define various data copying methods

* host SERVER_NAME - set of sections used to define servers parameters
